# Student Process Flow

This document outlines the possible process flows for students in the Arthur Jarvis University Student Fee Clearance system.

## 1. Authentication

- **Login**: Students log in using their university email and password.
- **Password Management**: Students can change their password from the dashboard.
- **Logout**: Students can securely log out of the system.

## 2. Dashboard Overview

- **Clearance Progress**: A progress bar shows the overall percentage of clearance units completed.
- **Unit Status**: Students can view the status of each clearance unit (e.g., Bursary, Exams & Records, Student Affairs).
  - **Cleared**: The unit has approved the student's clearance.
  - **Pending Review**: The student has submitted a receipt, and it is awaiting admin approval.
  - **Submit Receipt**: The student needs to upload a payment receipt for this unit.
  - **Rejected**: The submitted receipt was rejected.
- **Financial Summary**: Total amount owed across all units is displayed.
- **Urgent Actions**: High-priority units requiring attention are highlighted.

## 3. Fee Payment & Receipt Submission

- **Upload Receipt**: Students can upload images of their payment receipts for specific fees.
- **Fee Selection**: When uploading, students select the specific fee (e.g., Tuition, Medical, Library) and specify the academic year and semester.
- **Rejection Notifications**: If a receipt is rejected, the student receives a notification with the reason for rejection (e.g., "Blurry image", "Wrong amount").

## 4. Clearance Completion

- **Final Clearance**: Once all units are marked as "Cleared" (100% progress), the "Generate Clearance Slip" button becomes active.
- **Clearance Slip**: Students can generate and download a PDF clearance slip containing their details, a summary of cleared units, and a verification QR code.

## 5. Real-time Updates

- The dashboard updates in real-time when an admin officer approves or rejects a clearance status or receipt.
