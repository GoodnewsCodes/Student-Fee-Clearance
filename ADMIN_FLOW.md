# Admin Officer Process Flow

This document outlines the possible process flows for administrative officers in the Arthur Jarvis University Student Fee Clearance system.

## 1. Authentication

- **Login**: Admin officers log in using their staff email and password.
- **Role-Based Access**: The dashboard interface is customized based on the officer's assigned unit (e.g., Bursary, Admissions, ICT).
- **Password Management**: Officers can change their password from the dashboard.
- **Logout**: Officers can securely log out of the system.

## 2. General Admin Flow (All Units)

- **Student Verification**:
  - Search for students by track number or name.
  - View student profile details (Name, Track No, Email, Department).
  - View the student's clearance status across all university units.
  - View all payment receipts uploaded by the student.
- **Receipt Inspection**:
  - View high-resolution images of uploaded receipts.
  - Use zoom and pan controls to inspect receipt details.

## 3. Bursary & Accounts Officer Flow

- **Receipt Review**:
  - Access a dedicated "Receipt Review" tab showing all pending receipts.
  - **Approve Receipt**: Marking a receipt as approved automatically updates the student's clearance status for that specific unit to "Cleared".
  - **Reject Receipt**: Officers can reject invalid receipts and provide a reason (e.g., "Incorrect amount"). This notifies the student and removes the invalid receipt from the system.

## 4. Admissions Officer Flow

- **Student Registration**:
  - Access a "Register User" tab to onboard new students.
  - Input student details: Full Name, Track Number, Email, and Department.
  - Assign a default password for the student's first login.

## 5. ICT Administrator Flow

- **User Management**:
  - Register new users (both Students and Staff).
  - Search and filter the entire user database.
  - Delete user accounts when necessary (with confirmation).
- **System Oversight**:
  - Access all administrative functions, including verification and registration.
  - Manage staff unit assignments and roles.

## 6. Real-time Monitoring

- The admin dashboard updates in real-time as students upload new receipts, ensuring officers can process clearances as they arrive.
